## Features Implemented
- Responsive UI with interactive elements
- Smooth animations using GSAP and Locomotive Scroll
- Swiper JS for image carousels
- State management with React Context API
- API integration for dynamic content fetching
- Dark mode toggle

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** React.js, Tailwind CSS, GSAP, Locomotive Scroll, Swiper JS
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **State Management:** React Context API
- **Deployment:** Vercel/Netlify for frontend, Heroku for backend

## Challenges Faced & Solutions
### 1. **Performance Optimization:**
   - **Issue:** Animations causing lag on lower-end devices.
   - **Solution:** Used `requestAnimationFrame()` and optimized GSAP animations.

### 2. **Locomotive Scroll with GSAP Conflicts:**
   - **Issue:** Scroll-based animations were not working smoothly.
   - **Solution:** Synced Locomotive Scroll with GSAP ScrollTrigger to ensure smooth animations.

### 3. **API Call Delays:**
   - **Issue:** Slow API responses affected UI loading speed.
   - **Solution:** Implemented caching and lazy loading techniques.

## Future Improvements
- **Improve Accessibility:** Enhance keyboard navigation and ARIA attributes.
- **Offline Mode:** Implement service workers for offline access.
- **More Animations:** Add micro-interactions for better UX.
- **Better SEO:** Optimize metadata and improve page load speeds.
- **Advanced State Management:** Consider using Redux for more scalable state handling.
